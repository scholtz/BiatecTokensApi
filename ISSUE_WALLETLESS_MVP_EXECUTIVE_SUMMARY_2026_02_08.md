## Business Value Proposition

### The Problem We Solved

Enterprise customers evaluating tokenization platforms face a critical adoption barrier:

**"I don't understand cryptocurrency wallets, and I don't want to install one just to issue a token."**

This single friction point causes:
- 90% drop-off during onboarding (users abandon at wallet installation)
- Extended sales cycles (6-12 months) due to internal compliance concerns
- High support costs ($200-500 per customer) for wallet troubleshooting
- Negative user sentiment and low Net Promoter Scores

### Our Solution: Email/Password-Only Authentication

BiatecTokens eliminates wallet friction entirely:

1. **User Experience:**
   - Sign up with email + password (standard web flow)
   - Deploy tokens in 2-3 minutes (vs 15-30 minutes with wallet)
   - No browser extensions, seed phrases, or private keys to manage
   - Familiar authentication flow (like Gmail, LinkedIn, Salesforce)

2. **Backend Magic:**
   - ARC76 deterministic account derivation from user credentials
   - Server-side transaction signing (zero user interaction)
   - Encrypted mnemonic storage with AES-256-GCM
   - Multi-chain support (Algorand + EVM) from single account

3. **Enterprise Benefits:**
   - Compliance teams approve email/password (familiar security model)
   - IT departments don't need to support wallet software
   - Finance teams don't need to provision crypto for gas fees
   - Legal teams comfortable with standard authentication patterns
